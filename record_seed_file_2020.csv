2020-01-01,333,5.10d,beta,,,,Really fun route. This is a super cool wall,,1
2020-02-01,152,5.9,flash,,,,This was a really cool little crevice that had a couple routes. It was just really fun to hang with Zoe and have fun being outside doing the think I love most with the person I love most,,1
2020-02-01,343,5.7,flash,,,,"Found a really fun, more challenging variation to this route. Really proud of Zoe for flashing this one on lead",,1
2020-02-01,358,5.11a,flash,,,,"This route was so much fun. Long and sustained, but some great rests. There were a few difficult moves with some exposure. I was proud of myself for sending this, especially at a time where I felt like my endurance was still coming back",,1
2020-02-02,205,5.12b,beta,,,,"Wow this was a cool route. I pulled a couple draws to get clips and definitely hung a lot, but I am still proud of some of the moves I linked and for getting to the anchor",,1
2020-03-21,173,5.12a,redpoint,,,,Sent the route on my 4th try of the day! This climb is freaking awesome. Had so much fun on every attempt. Felt awesome to get through the crux,,1
2020-03-22,303,5.10c,beta,,,,"First route back after my broken foot. It felt amazing to be on rock again and I had fun on this route. I didn't finish because of the fall potential with the wet top area, but it was great to be back at it",,1
2020-03-22,276,5.11b,beta,,,,Really fun route. Pretty mellow other than a big lockoff crux in the middle of the route,,1
2020-03-22,276,5.11b,1 fall,,,,"Felt good on the lead, but I didn't get the sequence right. I would like to come back for this one. I bet I can get the send now that I am feeling more comfortable",,1
2020-03-22,288,5.11b,beta,,,,Tried the first lead and I ended up coming down at the top blank arete section. It felt pretty heady especially with me not wanting to take falls,,1
2020-03-22,288,5.11b,beta,,,,"So much fun on TR. The top section would be a difficult lead for me, but I think I can get this one too if I come back",,1
2020-03-22,395,5.10b,beta,,,,"Longest route at North Table. Pretty fun and sustained climbing, especially at the bulges in the top section. I did not have the endurance I needed on this one and struggled to get to the top, but I pushed hard and made it!",,1
2020-03-24,153,5.9,flash,,,,Fun climb with big moves. Some of the holds are quite polished. I like this climb,,1
2020-03-24,268,5.11a,beta,,,,Really great route. Has some technical climbing and some great rests. It is really fun how sequence dependent the middle crux is and then you get a great rest before pulling a super fun roof,,1
2020-03-24,268,5.11a,1 fall,,,,Fell on the roof on my redpoint try. But I came back on 3/29 and sent!,,1
2020-03-24,257,5.11c,beta,,,,"Felt really solid on TR (sent). This route is fucking awesome. Definitely the best at North Table. Technical, slabby section at the bottom onto a ledge for a no hands rest, then you get into some overhung gym climbing on great holds with super fun movement",,1
2020-03-24,189,5.10a/b,flash,,,,Nice cooldown. One tricky section - decent route,,1
2020-03-29,189,5.10a/b,flash,,,,Nice warmup. One tricky section - decent route,,1
2020-03-29,268,5.11a,redpoint,,,,"Sent the route!! I feel good about this. Sending a stout 11- after taking 6 weeks off for a broken foot - not too bad. Once I get my endurance up and continue hangboarding, I am going to sending some really good stuff over the summer",,1
2020-03-29,257,5.11c,1 fall,,,,Will definitely get this next time! I used some energy going right after the slab crux and had to come back down to move left up to the ledge (correct way). I got pumped in the overhung section and didn't have the best foot placement. I know that I can get this next time,,1
2020-03-29,244,5.11d,beta,,,,Very fun route. The corner/roof section is tough for me but really good practice at smearing technique and body positioning. Technical crux at the top that is really good for practicing technique,,1
2020-03-29,244,5.11d,beta,,,,Very fun route. The corner/roof section is tough for me but really good practice at smearing technique and body positioning. Technical crux at the top that is really good for practicing technique,,1
2020-03-31,311,5.10a,flash,,,,"Nice warmup. Cool line. Had some trouble in the beginning, but the first lead is for working out the kinks",,1
2020-03-31,257,5.11c,redpoint,,,,Sent the route!! I climbed well on the technical section and did well on the upper pumpy section. I am really happy that I went back and got this one. Such a fun climb!!!,,1
2020-03-31,179,5.12a,beta,,,,Great route,,1
2020-03-31,179,5.12a,beta,,,,"This is such a cool climb. Very thin and technical, but I think I got my beta worked out on the second TR run. I think one or two more on TR and then I will try for the lead. I really think that I can get this one",,1
2020-04-05,321,5.10a,flash,,,,Really unique climb with some fun holds and movement. Good & fun warmup,,1
2020-04-05,316,5.10a,flash,,,,"Another unique climb. Liked Perfect 10 a little better, but still a fun warmup",,1
2020-04-05,247,5.11d,beta,,,,"Very unique and technical climb. Similar to Feeding Frenzy. Not sure which I like better, but neither are necessarily my style of climbing. Still great to get on these kind of climbs and push out of my comfort zone. I just don't get that same fire to send these types, but I am always willing to support Tuck on these cause I know that this is his style",,1
2020-04-05,273,5.11b,beta,,,,"Such an amazing climb over a wide and sloping arete. I can't believe how cool this one is. Definitely in my top 3 North Table climbs (Industrial, Roseanne & Electrocuticles). It was tricky to figure out the moves on the initial lead, but this is definitely a beta dependent climb",,1
2020-04-05,273,5.11b,redpoint,,,,Cruised it on my second try!! I was bold and moved well through the cruxes. This route is definitely the style that ignites my fire for climbing and conquering routes. Love this climb,,1
2020-04-05,186,5.12a,beta,,,,"Tough and fun route, with some great crimps up top. The first low crux is very difficult and would require really dialing in the beta. Then you get an easier middle section that leads to some fun, very small crimps with good movement and then a big move to get a left hand on the arete. Fun climb for sure",,1
2020-04-05,3,5.12a,beta,,,,"This climb was actually pretty awesome. Tuck got on TR first and worked some of the moves, but he went left (which I think is off route). I was able to find the moves straight up the arete. I would certainly like to get on this one more and would definitely like to get the lead soon",,1
2020-04-05,249,5.11d,beta,,,,Very interesting start that leads to a difficult overhanging headwall. Super fun route - tough at the end of the day. This would be an awesome climb to pursure in order to gauge my endurance,,1
2020-04-07,244,5.11d,beta,,,,Did the bottom section for a warmup for Electrocuticles,,1
2020-04-07,179,5.12a,beta,,,,Figured out the beta again. Such an awesome route,,1
2020-04-07,179,5.12a,beta,,,,"Sent the route on TR!! I felt strong and had the beta dialed in, even after struggling on my first TR attempt. Definitely going for the lead on this soon. I am going to send this route",,1
2020-04-07,6,5.11c,beta,,,,This climb is seriously awesome. Tricky section at the bottom that leads into a really amazing roof with some of the best crimps I have ever grabbed at North Table. I am certainly going to get on lead soon and work for the send,,1
2020-04-07,354,5.11a,flash,,,,I will consider this a flash because I set the draws and hadn't been on this for at least 6 months. It was a great test to show how much my strength has improved. I climbed it sloppily and set the draws and still got the send. Really happy about that,,1
2020-04-10,44,5.10d,flash,,,,Fun climb - nice warmup,,1
2020-04-10,95,5.10c,1 fall,,,,Another good warmup - need to know the beta on the roof pull,,1
2020-04-10,73,5.11d,beta,,,,"Really amazing climb! The beginning section is just fun and cruiser and then you get a fun roof pull. After the roof is where the business starts and you gotta figure you way through some really small holds and almost no feet. Will take some time to dial in the beta on this one, but I am definitely going for the send soon",,1
2020-04-11,347,5.11a,onsight,,,,"Really great climb. I felt so solid on this - I said it was the easiest 11a I've ever climbed when I got to the top haha. This being the 4th day outside that week made me feel super relaxed and comfortable on the rock. It felt good to see a few other groups struggle on this, so it shows me that when I am dialed in and have some reps, I can really climb with a good head",,1
2020-04-11,174,5.12a,beta,,,,"Crazy roof with a gnarly overhanging hand jam that goes into a sharp, good flake for a huge lock-off to pull the roof. The feet are everything when you have the sharp flake and I just couldn’t seem to get my right foot solid in the crack",,1
2020-04-11,174,5.12a,beta,,,,"Gave this route quite a few burns trying to pull the roof. Not my favorite style of climbing, but it would be satisfying to get the roof. I think this would be a good test to see improvement as my lock-off strength continues to improve",,1
2020-04-11,207,5.11a,onsight,,,,"Such an awesome beginning. Can't imagine how hard the trad section is, but this was a fun and slightly challenging beginning",,1
2020-04-11,178,5.12a,beta,,,,"AMAZING CLIMB. So burnt out when I got on this, but I am absolutely coming back for the send",,1
2020-04-11,178,5.12a,beta,,,,Worked out the moves. It really all comes down to about 5-6 difficult moves and one clip at the end of that difficult section. I will get this soon,,1
2020-04-18,179,5.12a,beta,,,,Worked the beta and got everything dialed in for my lead attempt. It was awesome that Tuck set this with the stick clip and got all the ticks on. After dialing in the heel hook move on the crux I was pretty sure I was ready for the send attempt,,1
2020-04-18,179,5.12a,redpoint,,,,Sent the route!!!! MY FIRST 12a (see notable climbs),,1
2020-04-18,298,5.10c,flash,,,,I climbed this route really well. I was on such a high after sending Electrocuticles. This definitely had some committing moves and I just went through all of them. I felt on top of the world,,1
2020-04-19,319,5.10a,flash,,,,Great warmup. There are some sustained moves with great movement to navigate the slightly overhung section. Really enjoyed this one and felt solid,,1
2020-04-19,209,5.9,flash,,,,"Just great climbing. Nothing too special, but consistently fun the whole way. Great, great warmup",,1
2020-04-19,323,5.10a,flash,,,,Super unique and fun climb. I loved setting this one and especially enjoyed the sharp layback section. Graveyard keeps delivering with fun and enjoyable climbing,,1
2020-04-21,104,5.10b/c,flash,,,,Really great warmup. Some tough sections and thoughtful moves and foot placement. Kind of pumpy for a first climb (super long route) but a great way to get out of the head and warm up the fingers and forearms,,1
2020-04-21,104,5.10b/c,flash,,,,"Another good warmup, much easier than Bush Administration but also fun, long and great for getting out of the head",,1
2020-04-21,73,5.11d,beta,,,,"Really want to get this one soon. I was able to work the beta more on this one, but I just didn't feel great on the upper clips. Hoping to get a good day and weather here soon to get the send on this one. I know that I can get it, it is just going to require some precise climbing and the right beta for me",,1
2020-04-25,209,5.9,flash,,,,"Just great climbing. Nothing too special, but consistently fun the whole way. Great, great warmup",,1
2020-04-25,323,5.10a,flash,,,,Super unique and fun climb. I loved setting this one and especially enjoyed the sharp layback section. Graveyard keeps delivering with fun and enjoyable climbing,,1
2020-04-25,304,5.10c,flash,,,,"Another awesome climb in the warmup section of Graveyard. A bit more engaged and difficult in the start, but it leads to the best headwall section of the three I've been on so far. Really a great climb and warmup",,1
2020-04-25,178,5.12a,beta,,,,Set the route using the stick clip and then had a run on TR to work through the moves and get the holds brushed and chalked. I felt good on this run and felt like I could get the send,,1
2020-04-25,178,5.12a,beta,,,,SENT THE ROUTE!!!! My second 12a within a week. I felt so solid on the climb and was so stoked at the top. Climbing is awesome,,1
2020-04-25,250,5.11d,beta,,,,Really really good climb. Sustained climbing with ladder moves on very small and sharp crimps up top. Glad I got to check this one out.,,1
2020-04-25,250,5.11d,beta,,,,"Had fun giving it another go and learning beta a bit more. I was so shot by this point, but it is a great route and am looking forward to getting the send soon while we go back for Tuck to send Muertos",,1
2020-04-28,19,5.9,flash,,,,Great warmup. Fun climb with a good variation of holds. Easy traverse at the top to set the TR for Eiger Direct,,1
2020-04-28,73,5.11d,redpoint,,,,"MY FIRST 11D!!! Really happy that I got this one. Definitely spent some extra time with the movement, but damn is this climb technical. Very important to have the beta on this one. Tuck sent and I went up and sent right after, then we went home, satisfied as hell",,1
2020-05-02,193,5.12a,beta,,,,"This climb is hard, but awesome. Lots of pockets, some good some bad, technical and thin foot placements, some small crimps, some nice sidepulls. Overall a difficult, engaging and classic route. This is my current main project at Shelf",,1
2020-05-02,193,5.12a,beta,,,,Worked out more of the moves. The most challenging part of the climb for me is foot placement and finding the right feet quickly so that I don't put too much strain on my fingers & forearms,,1
2020-05-02,193,5.12a,beta,,,,"Got my beta pretty dialed in. Need to remember specific pockets for my feet, foot placement before committing to moves, trust the clipping stance with the wide counter balance foot, try to save as much energy as possible in the intro - get to the ledge quickly",,1
2020-05-02,193,5.12a,beta,,,,"Topped out on lead! I was so pumped at this point, but I am really proud that I got the full lead on such a difficult route. I feel like this one will come soon",,1
2020-05-02,248,5.11d,beta,TRUE,,,"Such a great climb. Classic for sure. Super sustained climbing on good holds with some heady feet and runouts. Real attempt needs to be done with a full tank. I'll get this one in the near future, but Gym Arete is my Shelf focus for now",,1
2020-05-02,299,5.10c,1 fall,,,,"VERY unique climb. Awesome rest at a ledge where you can turn around, lean into the rock and enjoy one of the most incredible views at Shelf. Fun route to cool down on after a big big day",,1
2020-05-02,390,5.10b,flash,,,,Very unique climb that follows a layback crack all the way up. Great body movement and sustained climbing. Another great warmup. Perfect for setting a TR on Gym Arete,,1
2020-05-02,393,5.10a/b,flash,,,,"Great warmup next to Gym Arete. A bit thin, which is a great intro for a weekend at Shelf. Gets your head in the game",,1
2020-05-03,301,5.10c,flash,,,,I thought this climb was absolutely great. The exposure combined with thoughtful climbing really gives you a good rush and was such an awesome way to wake up for the day,,1
2020-05-03,282,5.11b,flash,,,,Got this one while I was setting the draws! I felt strong and focused and was much better with my feet than the first time a year ago. Great great climb,,1
2020-05-03,182,5.12a,beta,,,,"Long, sustained, sharp and detailed. This climb is pretty awesome, but it sure kicked my ass this day. I was pretty sore and burnt out after the big day at the Gym. I used about all I had in my tank on Illegal Smile, so I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to this in better condition",,1
2020-05-07,281,5.11b,1 fall,,,,"Really fun route! So close to the send, just didn't have my forearms warmed up enough",,1
2020-05-07,281,5.11b,redpoint,,,,Sent the route! Great traverse crux with some strength involved. Lots of fun,,1
2020-05-09,157,5.9,flash,,,,"SUCH A COOL ROUTE. Aesthetic af. But really, incredible view & unique climbing",,1
2020-05-09,157,5.9,flash,,,,SO MUCH FUN,,1

2020-05-09,341,5.7,flash,,,,Great route. Excited to see Zoe lead this one,,1
2020-05-09,157,5.9,beta,,,,Went up again to top out and set the TR anchor for Andrology,,1
2020-05-09,171,5.12a,beta,TRUE,,,"This route is truly awesome. It's tough for sure, but I think that I will be able to get it when we come back for Memorial Day weekend",,1
2020-05-09,171,5.12a,beta,TRUE,,,"Worked the route some more and got the beta a little more. It was freezing and weather was coming in, so this was a quick attempt",,1
2020-05-10,160,5.9,flash,,,,"Kind of tricky in the bottom section, with not a lot of good feet. Other than that it is a great warmup with some fun moves",,1
2020-05-10,157,5.9,flash,,,,AMAZING ROUTE. The bottom slab move feels much better and the rest of the climbing is just straight up classic. One of the best views I've ever had on a climb,,1
2020-05-10,157,5.9,beta,,,,Went up again to top out and set the TR anchor for Andrology,,1
2020-05-10,171,5.12a,beta,TRUE,,,"Worked through the moves another time on TR. The crux sections definitely still felt hard, but I am getting really comfortable on the route. Just a freaking awesome route to be on.",,1
2020-05-10,171,5.12a,beta,TRUE,,,"First lead attempt! It went really well through the bottom 11+ climbing. I willed my way through the first crux (it was close, but I was so focused and in the zone) but when I got to the top crux I was pretty pumped and fell quickly. It took a while for me to dial in the top crux, but once I found the beta I actually moved through it pretty well. The little horn for your left hand (after the crux sequence) is surprisingly nice to clip off of. It looks small but it is pretty nice. Then move right to the nice flaky holds next to each other and DONT FORGET the left hand bump up to the nice crimp, and then set up and make the dyno",,1
2020-05-10,277,5.11b,flash,,,,This was a really awesome climb. I didn't want to stop climbing and it was great to get on one more really fun line and get a satisfying send for the day! I seriously love this place,,1
2020-05-16,190,5.12a,beta,,,,Figured out the difficult start and felt out the moves after the bottom crux,,1
2020-05-16,190,5.12a,redpoint,,,,SENT THE ROUTE!! This climb is really awesome. The only difficult section is the first 3-4 moves and then its just great 5.11 climbing from then on. Such a great route and it felt awesome to send my 3rd 12a,,1
2020-05-16,391,5.11b,flash,,,,"Barely got this one, I mean barely. I was pretty tired after Spontaneous and only sent because Tuck set it. But hey, I was pretty stoked to finally cross this one off the list",,1
2020-05-16,392,5.10b,flash,,,,Very fun climb. Unique climbing and a great warmup with a couple engaging moves near the top section,,1
2020-05-17,161,5.9,flash,,,,Short and simple climb. Set this one for everyone else to TR,,1
2020-05-17,259,5.11c,2 falls,TRUE,,,Such a great route,,1
2020-05-17,259,5.11c,1 fall,TRUE,,,So close to sending this one. I was pretty worn out and just couldn't get some of the moves dialed in. I definitely didn't feel like I was in the zone on this one. REALLY want to go back to 2150 Wall to send this and try Taping Tendons directly to the left,,1
2020-05-17,328,5.10d,flash,,,,Fun climbing. Exactly what I was looking for to cap off the weekend. Would be significantly harder if you were to go directly to the anchors on the face instead of move around the arete to the right,,1
2020-05-19,318,5.10a,flash,,,,Actually a really fun climb. Easy scramble to a high first bolt and then some fun moves on great crimps on the face to the anchors,,1
2020-05-19,6,5.11c,2 falls,,,,I want to get this one so bad!!,,1
2020-05-19,6,5.11c,2 falls,,,,Close but kept falling after pulling the roof,,1
2020-05-19,6,5.11c,2 falls,,,,Close but kept falling after pulling the roof,,1
2020-05-19,6,5.11c,2 falls,,,,"This was my best attempt in terms of beta, but I was just so pumped. I know that I can get this route next time. I need to stay low and fairly horizontal after the roof pull (instead of standing up) and then I can position to make the moves to gain the face to the left of the roof section. I think I will get this next time",,1
2020-05-19,253,5.11b/c,beta,TRUE,,,This route is seriously cool. Very tricky and low percentage move through the thin and technical crux. Otherwise the route is really fun and easy. Would love to get the send on this one,,1
2020-05-19,169,5.8,flash,,,,Climbed this one to clean the route for the top ropers,,1
2020-05-19,253,5.11b/c,beta,TRUE,,,"Went for the send in the dark! Felt pretty good, but I just didn't stick the crux move on the first go. The key is to cut the right foot and put all pressure on the tiny left toe edge in order to get enough purchase to stand and fall onto the right hand on the big ledge. This was probably the windiest climb I have ever done, so that was kind of fun",,1
2020-05-23,305,5.10c,2 falls,,,,I would say this is one of the only routes that I would say is bad. It's just really insecure and not very fun climbing that almost seems like it's not worth it. Probably won't be back to this one. But it was nice to get on something while we waited for Hot Zone,,1
2020-05-23,148,5.9,flash,,,,"AMAZING route as always. Bit of a tricky start, but overall just some great climbing with fun and unique holds/rock",,1
2020-05-23,148,5.9,flash,,,,Clipped the first few bolts of Hot Zone and then traversed right to the bolted section of Abbaye d'Orval. The moves on those few upper bolts are pretty awesome. I love that bit of climbing,,1
2020-05-23,261,5.11c,beta,,,,"This climb really showed a glaring weakness that I have been avoiding. OVERHUNG ROUTES. I need to seriously focus on them and push myself to get out of my comfort zone and feel weak and possibly discouraged in order to improve my overall climbing. I know that I can get to the point where I am comfortable in this space, but man did my feet feel of and my upper body feel tired. I eventually topped out. I am going to get this route",,1
2020-05-23,151,5.9,flash,,,,This route has some super fun and slightly difficult and sharp moves packed into a short climb. Really great climb,,1
2020-05-23,151,5.9,flash,,,,Cleaned the route,,1
2020-05-23,272,5.11b,flash,,,,I fought really hard on this one and got the send on the set!! I was really stoked to get through this one and it was truly an awesome climb. I would do this one over and over,,1
2020-05-23,335,5.10d,flash,,,,Another fight and amazingly fun and satisfying climb. It felt great to work this one. Truly an amazing route on one of the most beautiful and cool pieces of rock I have ever seen,,1
2020-05-25,339,5.10d,1 fall,,,,This route is freaking awesome. I tried to clip off the wrong hold and had to pull a draw when I was setting the route. So much fun,,1
2020-05-25,339,5.10d,flash,,,,Great freaking route. My favorite of these four warmups,,1
2020-05-25,250,5.11d,beta,,,,Worked the moves,,1
2020-05-25,250,5.11d,1 fall,,,,"The last clip is really tough for me, but I figured out some good beta on this one",,1
2020-05-25,250,5.11d,1 fall,,,,"Felt better and I was actually climbing really well. My foot slipped setting up for the last clip, but idk if I would have had it anyways",,1
2020-05-25,250,5.11d,1 fall,,,,Foot slipped on the last clip again - I need to be very deliberate when I place my right foot on that crimp that is almost covered by a small bulge. I may just skip the last clip next time,,1
2020-05-29,332,5.10d,1 fall,,,,Tough route with an engaging roof section,,1
2020-05-29,353,5.11a,1 fall,,,,Pretty fun route. Took at the top bulge section while I was setting the route,,1
