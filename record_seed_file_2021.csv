2021-01-20,202,5.12b,1 fall,,,,"Getting really close. The beta is getting dialed, I just need to be fresh and efficient and push through all of it",,1
2021-01-29,371,5.11b,2 falls,,,,"Tried to get the send on the set as a fitness test. I pushed so freaking hard, which was awesome! I was definitely rushing and go out of position a few times. Such an incredible route",,1

2021-05-22,283,5.11b,redpoint,,,,Super fun climb. Great moves down low and then a cool and crimpy traverse sets you up into the powerful section with good holds and less than great feet. Fight the pump and make it through,,1
2021-05-22,259,5.11c,1 fall,TRUE,,,"Really great route. Tough start and lower section. Just need to dial it a bit and push through to the great rest. Then hold on through the sustained, but restable upper section",,1
2021-05-23,196,5.12a/b,redpoint,,,,Felt freaking amazing on this climb. Everything felt dialed and precise. It feels truly awesome when I climb with precision and flow. Didn’t even feel pumped at the top. This is what it is all about. Truly a great feeling when you find that zone,,1
