2019-03-09,315,5.10a,1 fall,,,,Pumpy start. Could send for sure,,1
2019-03-09,204,5.12a,beta,,,,Massive roof. Such a fun route. Tuck and I will be back to try this one more,,1
2019-03-17,342,5.7,flash,,,,Warmup - fun route. Have done this one before,,1
2019-03-17,360,5.11a/b,2 falls,,,,"Steep overhang, but amazing holds. Need to climb past 4th clip and clip from above - could have sent with this beta. Will be back to try again",,1

2019-04-14,355,5.11a,redpoint,,,,Second attempt felt really good and I sent the route!,,1
2019-05-03,242,5.10c,1 fall,,,,"Tough warmup, but super fun route. Climb on the left wedge after an easy start. Can send next time in Moab",,1
2019-05-03,243,5.10a,1 fall,,,,"Such an amazing route. Pretty tough, but typical for Moab. Definitely need a stick clip. The climbing is sustained and so much fun all the way up",,1
2019-05-04,232,5.11a,beta,,,,This climb was awesome. I cant wait to come back and do battle with this one,,1
2019-05-04,229,5.12c,beta,,,,Followed Matt after he led and bailed around the 5th bolt. The start is incredible and then you get to the arete which is definitely where the 5.12c comes in. This could be a lofty goal for the recurring trips to Moab,,1
2019-05-05,241,5.9,flash,,,,Nice warmup. Very slabby with a difficult start,,1
2019-05-05,233,5.11b,beta,TRUE,,,"MOAB PROJECT. This route is so much freaking fun. Hard and sustained moves with a difficult start, but there are some good rests. I was proud to get to the top of this on lead, but I had to cheat on the start and at the last big move to the small crimps. Will return",,1
2019-05-11,284,5.11b,beta,,,,Tough roof to start with - couldn't get it this time (tired from Bouldering the previous day when Zoe got me a training session for my bday :D). The climbing get pretty fun after the roof with a little more difficulty as you get close to the anchors,,1
2019-05-11,177,5.12a,beta,TRUE,,,This route is really awesome. I would love to come back and give it more attempts,,1
2019-05-11,349,5.11a,2 falls,,,,"AMAZING CLIMB. The whole route is fun with really great holds and sustained shoulder and back pressure. I cant wait to come back and send this. The move to the anchor stumped me for a bit, but it is easily pulled by using a left foot heel hook and reaching up to the pinch with your left hand",,1
2019-05-18,164,5.8,flash,,,,Good warmup. Wasn't a huge fan of there not being an anchor and having to traverse and lower weirdly. Zoe didn't like top-roping this one,,1
2019-05-18,335,5.10d,beta,,,,"AMAZING CLIMB. Really sustained climbing. Feels harder than 10d, but that is the Monastery for ya. I love this place so freaking much and this climb is one that I will repeat over and over. I really hope that someone updates the hardware on the anchor soon tho",,1
2019-05-25,297,5.10b/c,flash,,,,"Super fun route. Kind of a tough warmup due to pump, but there were good rest along the climb. I really liked this area (about 5-10 routes right of Crynoid Corner)",,1
2019-05-25,299,5.10c,flash,,,,Very fun. Thought it was easier than Three-Quarter Ton. A few tough moves,,1

2019-05-25,248,5.11d,beta,TRUE,,,"Tuck and I were so pumped when we got on this. Neither of us could clip the 5th bolt on the crimp. I tried again and was ready to get it and realized I didn't have any draws, so we bailed lol. Would really love to come back to this. It was an awesome climb.",,1
2019-05-26,307,5.10a,flash,,,,Good warmup with a tough middle crux section,,1
2019-05-26,348,5.11a,beta,,,,"Roofs are very tough for me, but I still had a fun time on this one. Roofs are not intuitive for me, but once I find the right foot position then I can typically pull it. I just need more practice so that I can read my foot positioning better",,1
2019-05-26,330,5.10d,flash,,,,This was such an awesome way to end the weekend. Tuck and I both onsighted this one and felt awesome. Such a fun climb with a good rest after the sustained pumpy section,,1
2019-05-27,340,5.5,flash,,,,Warmup,,1
2019-05-27,296,5.10d,redpoint,,,,Pretty fun climb. Got stuck on the roof my first attempt and sent it on the second,,1

2019-05-31,44,5.10d,1 fall,,,,Great pitch. The roof shut me down both tries. I know that I can get it. No worries,,1
2019-05-31,78,5.11b/c,beta,,,,"This route was very tough, but it was fun to try. Also, I grabbed the carabiner from the girl next to us that had to bail, so that was sweet",,1
2019-06-02,325,5.10a,flash,,,,Good warmup. I really like this route. Fun moves back and forth on the arete,,1
2019-06-02,322,5.10a,flash,,,,"Such an awesome climb. Cool exposure, long route, huge variation. I will always be down to climb this one",,1
2019-06-02,338,5.10d,flash,,,,Pretty proud of the flash on this one. I had some beta so I was able to reach to the right hold on the initial crack. Cool route to be able to do since we could set up a TR,,1
2019-06-02,302,5.10c,2 falls,,,,"This route is incredible. Three cruxes, all different. Definitely want to come back and get on this again. Don't even need the send, just want to enjoy this amazing route. I slipped twice on the slabby crux and took some fun unexpected falls",,1
2019-06-02,255,5.11c,redpoint,,,,"SENT ON MY 2ND TRY!! I am so happy that I sent this route. I have never felt more in the zone climbing. I went for moves that I wasn't sure on and they all stuck. This just shows me that I can climb harder than I do, the only thing in my way is my mental game",,1
2019-06-09,314,5.10a,flash,,,,"Super fun climb, very unique. Zoe did great on this one",,1

2019-06-09,337,5.10d,flash,,,,Really stoked to flash this one! Crux was a tough slabby move that I was able to stand through. Proud that I was able to get this one.,,1
2019-06-11,366,5.10a,flash,,,,"Tall juggy route that goes over a fairly steep roof. Pumpy warmup, but fun route",,1
2019-06-11,370,5.10c,1 fall,,,,"Fun route, I went at the small roof/mantle move wrong the first time, but easily got it the 2nd try",,1
2019-06-11,371,5.11b,beta,,,,THIS CLIMB IS INCREDIBLE. Steep and fun climbing all the way up. Stopped at the roof to let Tuck climb it. I know that I could get this one. I want to work on it and definitely get back soon,,1
2019-06-13,154,5.9,flash,,,,Great warmup. Secure and good movement,,1
2019-06-13,149,5.9,flash,,,,Also a great warmup. Didn't think it was as fun as Buckets of Rain,,1
2019-06-13,256,5.11c,1 fall,,,,"Awesome climb!! Small, sharp crimps. Lots of body tension. So much fun. Want to come back soon for the send, but I am really proud that I got it in 1 fall on my first attempt",,1

2019-06-15,345,5.11a,flash,,,,So stoked to flash this one! This is my hardest onsite to date. Very fun route,,1

2019-06-20,104,5.10b/c,1 fall,,,,Another long and really fun route. Good roofy crux,,1
2019-06-20,384,5.10a/b,1 fall,,,,Super long and fun route. Took the longest fall I've ever taken outside after my foot slipped at the crux 14 bolts up. The rope stretched a ton and my feet went above my head - kinda scary but also a good experience,,1
2019-06-25,158,5.9,flash,,,,Great warmup with a somewhat tricky roof,,1
2019-06-25,170,5.8,flash,,,,Pretty easy route. Fun cruiser,,1
2019-06-25,308,5.10a,flash,,,,"Pretty fun, but confusing route haha",,1
2019-06-25,344,5.7,flash,,,,This route is awesome. Bouldery start with great stemming through the middle and a fun layback near the anchor. Cant wait to get back to High Wire and have Zoe lead this one,,1

2019-06-29,258,5.11a,beta,,,,This route was so much fun. Best stemming I have done outside,,1
2019-06-29,336,5.10d,flash,,,,My feet felt great and I sent the difficult starting section with ease this time. The huecos after the start are seriously incredible,,1
2019-06-29,262,5.11c,beta,,,,Tough and fun route. The crimps at the top were so sharp and tough to stand up on. Had a ton of fun fighting on this one,,1
2019-06-30,310,5.10a,flash,,,,Such a cool climb. Huecos are dope af,,1

2019-07-05,215,5.10b/c,1 fall,,,,"Also fun climbing. You climb up into a corner that has cool moves to get up and around. Fun pockets on the left face of the corner and then a big move to shift left and pull over. Wish I could have sent, but I was pretty beat at this point and was just having fun",,1
2019-08-03,159,5.9,flash,,,,"Fun climb on a nice arete. 1st bolt had fallen off, but it felt ok to get to the second (enjoyed the rush). Zoe led this one and did amazing!! I was so proud of her for pushing past her fear",,1
2019-08-03,261,5.11c,beta,,,,I LOVED the face climbing on this route (first 4 bolts). The overhang made the shouldery moves difficult but so engaging and fun. I would love to try this one again. I think this is a good goal or at least a good gauge for my progress.,,1
2019-08-03,335,5.10d,redpoint,,,,"I AM SO HAPPY I SENT THIS!! Billy was belaying me and I just felt so in the zone. I never felt pumped for a second. My legs were shaking like crazy, but I pushed through and finished the route. That really shows improvement since I first tried it in May.

2019-08-18,10,5.11a,redpoint,,,,Sent this one easily!! It is so great to feel how much I am improving. This is such a fun route and a great gauge for 5.11 readiness. I should be focusing mainly on 11's outside,,1
2019-08-18,365,5.10a,redpoint,,,,Great climb in the corner between Wet Dream and Reefer. Fun stemming and movement. The crux at the top is all about footwork and correct placement,,1
2019-09-15,104,5.10b/c,flash,,,,Great warmup. Small roof and some sustained climbing. Little Eiger is great for long and fun routes,,1
2019-09-15,104,5.10b/c,flash,,,,"Another fun and long route. This one has a tricky dihedral and also a slightly overhung move. Felt great on this one. Really a good lead and good route, especially to get into the lead zone",,1
2019-09-15,44,5.10d,flash,,,,Very fun slab climbing until a big roof with awesome jugs. I would like to do all 4 pitches of this route sometime,,1

2019-09-19,345,5.11a,beta,,,,Pumped myself out early and then had a really difficult time figuring out the crux. Definitely harder to move right and up on the crux. John found an easier move to go straight up off of the nice left hand at the start of the crux,,1
2019-09-19,345,5.11a,redpoint,,,,Used John's beta and sent the route easily. I flew through the bottom and pulled the crux easily to get over the roof to the anchors. Climbing a route more than once really makes a huge difference,,1
2019-10-02,199,5.12a/b,beta,,,,"This was such a cool climb. The beginning had a fun layback and some big moves to smaller crimps. I felt great on that section, but then you get to the crux on the last couple bolts. I wasn't able to stay on the wall for these moves, but it was sure fun trying it over and over on the rope.",,1
