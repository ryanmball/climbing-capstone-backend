2021-07-24,594,5.12c,beta,TRUE,,Nick,"Such an awesome climb! The mono was so much fun and the big moves at the start were epic. I think this would be a little out of grasp based on how difficult the top is and how much pump builds on the lower section, but I would love to come back to this one",,1
2021-07-21,96,5.11b,flash,FALSE,3.5,Courtney,"This was such a special day. It was our first date and it start blowing wind and raining while I was on this route. I dialed it in and sent, quickly cleaned, got to the ground in the pouring rain and we stared each other straight in the eyes and had our first kiss. I will never forget this moment and feeling with her",,1

2021-08-15,939,5.10a,flash,FALSE,3.5,Aaron,One of the coolest 10a's I've ever done! Right next to the refrigerator crack. Damn Ten Sleep is cool,,1
2021-08-15,936,5.12a,flash,FALSE,3.5,Aaron,Difficult V4 off the deck and then an easy V3 as the second crux. Felt awesome to get this one even though it felt a little unfair to be able to reach the best hold at the start,,1

2021-08-16,1399,5.12a,onsight,FALSE,4,Aaron,AMAZING. Multiple times on this route I said how freaking fun it was! I can't believe how cool this route is and also to get the onsight while setting draws!!! LIMIT LIMIT LIMIT and I held on with the power screams. Very emotional to get to the anchor on this one,,1
2021-08-16,1394,5.11c,2 falls,TRUE,,Aaron,So fucking fun. What an incredible finish to a very mediocre 10a start. I will absolutely do this one again when I am back in the area. It was fun taking the massive whip at the top!,,1
